PHASE_1 "ACQUIRING THE STRING"


Description:
Phase 1 is about giving a string. If the given input string matches the given string (string given by Dr Evil), then bomb at phase 1 is defused. 
The string used for defusing phase 1 of bomb 003 is "Border relations with Canada have never been better." 


1. objdump -d bomb > bomb.s							//diassemble the code of bomb file in assembly form in bomb.s

2. ls										//new file named bomb.s is created 

3. chmod +x bomb								//grants permission to access file

4. strings bomb								//gives all the strings of the bomb

5. gdb bomb									//gdb debugger executes the assembly code

  (gdb) info break								//checks whether the breakpoints or watchpoints are set or not
  
  (gdb) break phase_1								//set breakpoint to avoid exploding of bomb when input is 											wrong
  
  (gdb) run									//running the program

  Welcome to my fiendish little bomb. You have 6 phases with
  which to blow yourself up. Have a nice day!
  let us try									//input any random string

  Border relations with Canada have never been better.				//bomb at phase_1 is defused with this string 
  Phase 1 defused. How about the next one?
